                <h4>Pocketpair, the Developer and Publisher</h4>
                <p>Founded in 2015 by Takuro Mizobe, Pocketpair has only released <u>two</u> games: 
                    Craftopia and Palworld. Craftopia saw <i>some</i> success, but was by no means as 
                    successful as Palworld has been for the company. This first game release of 
                    their's, similarly to Palworld, followed an open-world, survival, action, and 
                    RPG genre. Although, we do miss out on the Pok√©mon-like creature collecting in 
                    Craftopia. Palworld and Craftopia have faced similar criticisms as well, as some 
                    people claim that they are <b>asset flips</b>, meaning that the developer purchases 
                    generic assets (rather than creating them) to fill out the game. Check out the 
                    Craftopia trailer and look for similarities/differences.
